Data prep scripts with `rvtable` dependency

Scripts here are generally related to data extraction from SNAP climate and wildfire maps, 
which is prepared for use in various projects in the form of
spatial probability distributions of random variables using the `rvtable` package.
This repository helps to isolate projects and code that use `rvtable` from the `rvtable` package itself,
since these scripts are beyond the scope of small reproducible examples. See `rvtable` for such examples.
